I went home at the end of the day and decided I would go back to the mansion on my own and have a look around. 

I looked through most of the rooms, I had a weird feeling as if I were being <break/><break/>watched the whole time. 

It was very cold even though it was summer.

I visited the spot where the woman supposedly <break/><break/><break/>hung <break/>herself.

After a while, I found a circular room draped in red curtains and in the middle of the room was a great big black <break/>grand piano facing with its keys away from me.

Then I heard music, a slow sad tune issued from the piano and I heard<break/> a woman singing, she sang <break/><break/>"Servo meus animus vox vocis of piano"<break/> I didn't know what it meant at the time.

The red drapes began to blow as if there were a high wind in the room,<break/> the music stopped and I stood for a moment, then took a pen from my pocket and wrote out the bizarre words she had sung to me.<break/> "Servo meus animus vox vocis of piano" is Latin for "Save my soul voice of the piano".


Ever since my beloved father past away,<break/> I couldn't get a hold of myself for weeks. 

He was the one who loved my the most and cared for me the most because I was his favorite child. 

I miss him so much. I almost gotten over him until it happened to me.

My grandfather died on my grandmother's anniversary of <break/>her death.

So you can say that he had waited until that day and then <break/><break/>die peacefully.

My mother said that it was a miracle that my grandfather <break/>died at the same day as my grandmother and that they must've love each other so much that on the day he died, my grandmother was there to take him away.

Just thinking about this makes me want to cry.

I know this is a long time,<break/> but it's true.

Five months had past and I have almost forgotten all about my grandfather.

Just almost.

Finally, after everyone was gone, <break/>we went in the restricted area. We took a few pictures by the fireplace and we left. A couple of days later I flew home.

After about 1 week I got the pictures developed. I looked and saw a figure of a man standing by the fire place and it was said that the room was haunted by Jack the Ripper's ghost.

So I go to my house and showed my wife.

Then we went to our friend's house. <break/>We showed him the pictures. <break/>But when we showed him<break/><break/> the phone <break/>rang <break/>. So he thought that was weird.

He picked up the phone and there was a lady with a weird accent. <break/>But she said that he called her.


We checked in,<break/> went to our room to get settled and wait for the dining room to open at 5pm.


We were the first to be seated in the dining room.

I even took pictures in hopes of "catching" something... nothing. While the dining room looked a bit tired and past its prime, the food was wonderful! Very generous portions, nicely presented, so we had a great dinner with no "visitors..." I was terribly sad, but I guess it wasn't meant to be.

We went back to our room, turned the television on and watched news for a short while when we heard someone moving into the room right next to us. 

With a seemingly empty parking lot... Why do they put people in rooms right next to each other?

We were getting a little concerned as our new neighbors were a bit too loud.

Not their television, but conversation muffled and lots of walking around.

My husband always travels with earplugs just for occasions like these (noisy hotel neighbors).

He seemed to be okay for the evening we turned the lights off went to sleep.

Well, last year my wish was granted when I got a birthday present from my boyfriend.

It was a gift certificate for me to stay one night at The Myrtles Plantation.

He only had one stipulation. He was not staying with me. His quote was, "I don't know if I believe in ghost or not and I don't plan on finding out."

That was fine with me because I had several friends who were interested in going with me. I called a friend of mine from out of town and asked her if she would meet me at the house for a night. I called the next day to book the room and there next opening was 6 months away so I booked it and waited.

Now I could speed all day telling you about the history of The Myrtles Plantation, between the history tour, the ghost tour and what I have read on line, but there is just too much information.

You can Google it and find all sort of information.

To start we had a hard time getting into our room. The key would not turn to open the door.

My friend went to go get the guy working that day and as they came up the stairs the door decided to open.

We had a great time that night. We took the history tour during the day and the ghost tour at night. 

We stayed up late and walked the grounds at night. We heard several noises, some could later be explained and some could not.

The reason for my story is to show a picture I captured while I was there and to get some of your input on it.

I had several pictures with orbs in places there was nothing shiny and no water around. We got pictures that part of the photo was blurry but not all of it.


I want to tell you a little about the house in case anyone plans on going there.


The grounds outside are beautiful, but the house itself is old and once inside you can see that.

It does make the whole haunting thing seem a bit more authentic but for a bed in breakfast, don't expect a 5 start hotel treatment.

There are no TV's, radio's, computers, internet connections, or anything electronic in the house. It also has poor lighting in every room.

The atmosphere is set up to scare people.
 
We could hear everything inside and outside of the house from our room.

For instance there was a noise we kept hearing in our room upstairs and we could not tell where it was coming from.

Well, before we left we realize that anytime someone shut a door we could hear the chandelier rattle.

I have also learned that most of the stories they tell on the Ghost Tour can not be confirmed to be true. It doesn't mean they are completely made up or that they place is not haunted, just that the origin of the hauntings may not be accurate.

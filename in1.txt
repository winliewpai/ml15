The story I will be telling you are the experiences we had in our house.<break/> Our house was built about 30yrs ago.


Fourty years ago,<break/> my parents did a bit of remodeling in the house and also rearranged some furnitures. Since then, we experienced a lot of strange things in the house but the most common are the white shadows. You know, those things that you see in your peripheral vision.

One day I was driving down the road late at night around 11:00pm and my car just shut off, I couldn't see anything because my headlights were off and my flashlight was missing. 

Back on October 15, 1956, my girlfriend thought it would be a good idea to take me to the cemetery in my hometown, a week before my birthday, as one of my presents.

About 20 years ago me and a mate used to go to this caravan site a couple of miles up the coast from where I used to live. 

During the summer we used to drink in the sites pub called the Mermaid, booze on the beach and chat up the holiday maker's daughters etc.

I have had several <break/> supernatural things happen to me over the years. 

My great grand mother was a gifted psychic and I guess that I inherited a little bit of an ability to see things that others can't. 

First some background... <break/> <break/> I am from the town nearby and lived there till I married.

My grandparents lived in a very small town, it can be found outside of the city to the north.

I was once driving back home from a long trip. I was driving from another city going back to my hometown.<break/> It was about 2:30 AM and I finally made it back.

I know that this is not a very <break/> scary story, but I think it's very good. 

It's <break/><break/> a true story. 

I hope that he<break/> forgives me for sharing my story with you all. 


Ever since my beloved grandfather <break/> past away, I couldn't get <break/> a hold of myself for weeks. He was the one who loved my the most and cared for me the most because I was his favorite grandchild.<break/>

 I miss him so much. <break/> I almost gotten over him until it happened to me.

In my town, there is a huge mansion on the edge of the park, <break/> it's open to visitors and people who want to walk through its many rooms, there are tours etc.

I took the behind the scenes tour which brought us to the basement of the a famous mansion in my city.

I spent a memorable night at my cousin's. 

It was memorable for me, because of the activity. Memorable for my cousin, because it firmly cemented in her mind that she would never <break/> return.

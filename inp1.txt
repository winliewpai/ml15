I was laying in bed with my hands under my pillow when a hand just pet the top of my head. 

My wife ran in and said <break/> honey <break/> what's wrong <break/> and I just told her that something pet my head and she said don't worry I'm right here.

She left the door open, left the room and I said go away. 

The next morning I got up and the door was closed, thinking my wife closed it I went to open it and it wouldn't open, I used a little more force but it still wouldn't open so then I used 2 hands and tugged as hard as I could and it just swung open.

I went and asked my wife if she closed the door and she said no.

I was laying on the couch because I felt like sleeping on the couch. 

I turned towards the hallway when two blobs slowly floated from my room to the living room. 

She came over and asked what was wrong and I looked really scared. 

I pointed towards the hallway and said 2 things just floated by my room into your's. 

She said it was nothing and just my imagination.

This all happened at my old house and I think my mom knew it was haunted but just didn't want to scare me. 

Well, tell me what you think and what they could have been.

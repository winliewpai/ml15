This might sound weird but this happens mostly in the bathroom.

Sometimes when I'm in there I hear people wisper <break/> my name or say <break/><break/> hey what's up.

I get really scared <break/> and they still <break/><break/><break/> talk today.

Only once in a while I hear footsteps on the part of the roof I can see.

Sometimes it will happen in my room.

I have no idea what it could be.

Tell me what you think and what it could be.

This just happened a few months ago.

One day <break/>I was playing basketball when the ball hit the base of the hoop. It started going down a hill and I went to get it. I grabbed the ball and looked up.

There was a shadow standing there leaning on a tree (my house is surrounded by woods) and there was something on its head. It was dawn so I grabbed the ball and ran. 

The next day I asked my neighbor if he knew what it was, and he said that witchers used to walk around the woods a long time ago.

And deep in the woods a house <break/> burned down and the 2 people that lived there <break/><break/> died in the fire.

Well tell me what you think it was.
